## Opening (10 mins)

Lets recap the morning:

- What part of an Android app handles the logic?
- Gary is a co-worker working on a side-project and asked me to help - what should Gary do and what should I do to make sure I can edit Gary's code on my computer?

## Introduction: Why Java? (15 mins)

Well, for Android, you need it.

Some context:

- Created by James Gosling/Sun in the mid-90s
- Was supposed to be "write once, run anywhere"
- Basically for servers
- Android first serious UI usage
- Object oriented

#### Java Compilation

Java code is just text that is later "compiled" into machine readable code. All languages technically do this at some point.

There are some unique ideas relating to Java:

- (Mostly) Everything is a class/object
- Unlike scripting languages, you can't just "run" a file
- There's now a language called `Kotlin` that compiles like java, and can be used for Android development. There are (online resources)[https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Kotlin%20Koans/Introduction/Lambdas/Task.kt] available, But we won't talk about it more today.

## Demo: Data types (30 mins)

>Instructor Note: Be sure to attempt to have students code along with you in some type of interactive Java shell. We do not have one recommended right now. Just creating and manipulating strings and numbers on the fly is helpful for students to see.

Java is all about primitives and objects. Primitives are basic data types and objects are data collections (basically).

An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.

All programming languages have something like the following: numbers, strings, booleans, collections.

> Instructor Note: For the following slides, prompt audience to give examples for type (ex. integer = 3).

#### Numbers

These include:

Integers (whole numbers)
- 1, 5, 2018
- data types: byte, short, int, long

Floats (decimal numbers)
- 1.1, 2.3, -0.5
- data types: float, double

> Instructor Note: Ask if anyone knows about type differences (ex. difference between an int and a long), but don't get much deeper than some datatypes are good for big numbers (long, double) and some for small numbers (byte)

#### Strings
- any kind of text
- designated by double quotes

#### Booleans
Think of these as a yes/no kind of value.

#### Variables

Variables are simply a place to store data. The type of data is declared before the variable name (Java has stong typing). Variable names, by convention, start lower case, with capitals for new words (Camel case).

...and you can join strings by concatenating variables!

#### Some methods we'll be writing

`System.out.println(wholeString);` writes a string out to the terminal.

This is very useful for finding problems in your code.
But don't worry about that quite yet.

## Guided Practice: Writing Methods (25 mins)

A method is a list of instructions.  When creating methods, you'll see some other words floating around. Visibility is only important once you get into classes, and if you see synchronized, you're probably in the wrong place.

Note that all methods are part of a class (but don't worry about that yet).

All methods have:
- A return type (the type of the answer)
- A name
- (optional) Parameters (the inputs)
- The code body (where the logic takes place)

To call a method, use the name, pass params, and profit.

There are some other words floating around, such as `public` and `private`. These basically have to do with whom can talk to each other. A private method is internal to a class, meaning it can't be called from the outside.

A `static` variable or function doesn't need to be called on an instance of a class. It is always the same across all instances. More about that later.

> Check: What do you expect this code to do?

#### Code along (JUnit)


For the following few exercises we will be writing methods and asserting that the results are what we expect by using jUnit. Automated testing is a powerful way to ensure that the code we write works the way we expect it too.

Do this with me:

- Open the repo that we cloned earlier and create a java file called YouSaidTest.java
- Write a method that takes a string input that prints it out with "You said: ", and the string param
- Call the method and assert that your answer was correct in a jUnit Test

You should have gotten:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class YouSaidTest {

    public String youSaid(String userInput) {
        return "You said: "+userInput;
    }

    @Test
    public void youSaid_isCorrect() {
        String result = youSaid("blue");
        assertEquals("You said: blue", result);
    }
}
```

## Independent Practice: Refactor the code (15 mins)

#### Git branches
Have you ever made a copy of something, because you didn't want to lose the original?
Git branches are a useful tool to add to your toolkit. They can be used for building a feature, or fixing a bug in an isolated sandbox, meaning the code that you write won't effect other people, and can be easily merged or deleted, as necessary.

The Android project we are using for this workshop has a few branches. Let's look at them now.

```
git branch                            # shows a list of branches
git checkout <branch-name>            # checks out a branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>         # creates a new branch
```

You can switch to a different branch with the `git checkout <branch-name>` command.

Everyone please checkout branch `feature/user-input`. Notice that this branch contains another test file `MathTest`, and that it is broken. Your task: Fix the test!

Create a function that takes as parameters two numbers, and returns the product of those numbers. Run the android unit test and assert that your new function works as expected.

> Instructor Note: Go slowly when walking through git branching.

## Break (5 mins)


## Demo: Android Input Forms (20 mins)

We are now going to start really building an android application.

Please do the following:
* Open up `BasicActivity`.
* Notice the line `setContentView(R.layout.activity_basic)`
  *check* What do you think this line does?
* Open up `R.layout.activity_basic`
* Add the following, explaining each part:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout
        android:id="@+id/tilYouSay"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:hint="@string/say_it_hint">

        <android.support.design.widget.TextInputEditText
            android:id="@+id/etYouSay"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
    </android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout>

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/btnSayIt"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/btn_say_it"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@+id/tilYouSay" />

</android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout>
```
* Note: `TextInputLayout` is a good option for user input because it allows easy showing of errors to the user. However, it is not included in the default android view components. Add the following to the dependancies in your `build.gradle` file:

```    
implementation 'com.android.support:design:27.1.1'
```

* Hardcode a string, and note the lint error. Fix it.
* Reasons you should use string resources, rather than hardcoded strings include:
  - translation
  - easy to update
* Show the design tab
* Ask students, what they think would happen if they ran it now. Would the button be clickable? What would it take to make it interactive?
* In `BasicActivity.java`:
  * grab the input element by it's id.
  * grab the button by it's id.
  * copy over the get user input method from the jUnit test. Make it public static, so the test doesn't break.
  * add a click listener to the button that gets the input, calls the method, and makes a toast with the result
* Run it.

> Instructor Note: As you code, talk about the typical way that a android file is setup, with the variables on top, followed by the lifecycle methods, followed by the private methods.

> Bonus (if time): Add a verify method and show an error if user input is empty

## Independent Practice: User Input Forms (20 mins)

> Instructor Note: Push the code. Ask students to pull. Ensure they all have the updated code.

Now your turn.

Add another two input boxes to this activity, and another button, labeled "Multiply". Hook up the method that you wrote in `MathTest.java`. Toast the result.

> TODO: Find bonus activities. Setup branches with fragments etc. for students to look at.

## Conclusion (10 mins)
